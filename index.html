        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Calvin Hall. I would describe myself as a junior Java developer.
          I've got about 9 years experience working with Java, since early middleschool.
          I got into programming because of runescape bots. Back during all the botting rage,
          I decided to try and make my own by piecing other mods together into a "frankenstein"
          amalgamation of different code scraps.
          I never really enjoyed web development, as I always thought it was more about making a pretty
          design than solving actual issues.
